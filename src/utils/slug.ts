/**
 * Create a URL-safe, human-readable slug from an arbitrary string.
 *
 * A slug is a stable identifier used in URLs, typically derived from a title.
 * It is lowercase, uses hyphens as separators, removes diacritics, and strips
 * non-alphanumeric characters. Example: "Tea Bowl (Shino Glaze)" â†’ "tea-bowl-shino-glaze".
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Output is trimmed to a maximum reasonable length to keep URLs concise.
 * - Uniqueness is NOT enforced here; append a suffix at call sites if needed.
